			<h1>MUSARE PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
			<h4>Last Updated: January 25, 2016</h4>

			<h4>1. Introduction</h4>
			Musare.com respects your privacy and the security of your personal
			information, and we want to do as much as we can to protect it.
			Because of this, we have created this Privacy Policy to govern how
			we deal with your personal information. Since our Site is built off
			of Content that you provide, including shared information from third
			party sites, it is important that you read and understand their
			information sharing policies as well. Please check back often, as we
			will update this Privacy Policy as we grow.

			<h4>2. Personal Information We Collect</h4>
			<p>
				In order for you to sign up for our service, we may ask for
				personal information from you including your name, e-mail
				address, mailing address, phone number, photo, username from
				other social media sites, gender, date of birth, or other
				relevant information. In addition, we utilize third party API’s
				that allow you to transfer your profile information from those
				Sites to ours depending on your settings on those Sites. We are
				not responsible for any information that does not transfer or if
				any information is inaccurate.
			</p>

			<p>
				Your use of any of the video or chat features may be recorded or
				logged by our servers. We may use this data to improve our Site
				or Platform, or to determine how best to provide marketing
				opportunities to you.
			</p>

			<p>
				We use the above referenced information to contact you regarding
				your account, assist in customer service and support, and to
				improve our Site and the musare.com platform. We also use the
				information we collect to send periodic communications to you
				regarding updates to our Site, new features, and marketing
				opportunities that we think you may find interesting.
			</p>

			<p>
				We may send you periodic emails that concern updates or
				features. We make sure to comply with CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, 15
				U.S.C. 7701 whenever we send you these goodies. If you feel that
				you are receiving unwanted messages from us (which we hope isn’t
				the case!) then please use the unsubscribe button or email us at
				musaremusic@gmail.com to remove yourself from our list. Please
				allow for up to ten (10) business days to process the removal.
			</p>

			<h4>3. Non-Personal Information</h4>
			<p>
				We may collect information about you that we consider to be less
				sensitive. When you access our website, we may collect such
				things as your IP address, browser, operating system, and other
				information that helps us know about the general nature of our
				visitors. We use this information to improve our Site and the
				musare.com platform.
			</p>

			<h4>4. Cookies</h4>
			<p>
				We use tracking cookies to distinguish you from other users to
				help prevent one user from unwittingly logging into another
				user’s account on the same computer or network. In conjunction
				with third party API’s, we also allow you to login using your
				credentials on those third party sites. These Sites may use
				cookies to track your web browsing, and have separate privacy
				policies that you must read. In addition, any time you share
				Content with others those third party Sites may collect
				information about people who view or share that Content. You
				must also read their privacy policies.
			</p>

			<p>
				We also may use tracking cookies to help ourselves or third
				party advertisers increase the effectiveness and quality of, and
				interest in, our marketing programs, or for other advertising or
				marketing purposes.
			</p>

			<p>
				Any advertisements served by Google, Inc., and affiliated
				companies may be controlled using cookies. These cookies allow
				Google to display ads based on your visits to this site and
				other sites that use Google advertising services. Learn how to
				opt out of Google’s cookie usage. As mentioned above, any
				tracking done by Google through cookies and other mechanisms is
				subject to Google’s own privacy policies.
			</p>

			<p>
				Your use of the Site may require that you have cookies turned
				on, depending on your login preferences.
			</p>

			<h4>5. User Content</h4>
			<p>
				We may allow you to post Content to our website, including
				videos and music. This content, once posted, is available for
				anyone to see and you are granting us the limited license for
				our use in accordance with our Terms of Service. As such, you
				must make sure you do not post anything that you do not have the
				rights to distribute. Please engage your brain when posting
				content.
			</p>

			<h4>6. Third Party Sites</h4>
			<p>
				Since our Site is built off of Content and sharing, you can be
				sure that you will encounter links to third party sites or
				Content that is being displayed from a third party site. Anytime
				you encounter a link to a website outside of musare.com, you
				should know that we have no control over that Site. We recommend
				that you consult those websites privacy policies, terms of
				service, and other similar documents when using them.
			</p>

			<p>
				You may also have the ability to interface, through the use of
				APIs, with third party websites such as social websites like
				Facebook, GitHub and Twitter. Be advised that we cannot be
				responsible for any breaches of privacy that may arise from the
				use of these third party websites.
			</p>

			<h4>7. Access to Information and Data Storage</h4>
			<p>
				We may host data with third parties and allow third parties to
				access, maintain, or otherwise use your information for purposes
				that we deem conducive to improving our business and service. We
				will strive to always deal with reputable providers, but we
				cannot make any guarantees. As such, you hereby agree that we
				are not liable for any privacy breaches that may occur as a
				result of the actions of third parties. In addition, how you
				interact with our Site may be shared with the third party
				service that you used to login, which means you are also storing
				information on their servers, which is governed by their own
				agreements.
			</p>

			<h4>8. Law Enforcement</h4>
			<p>
				We may disclose your information to a third party where we
				believe, in good faith that we are required to for legal
				purposes. The disclosure may be due to a criminal investigation,
				or a civil subpoena. If we receive such a request we may, but
				are not required to, notify you of such request and give you an
				opportunity to respond.
			</p>

			<h4>9. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</h4>
			<p>
				We do not allow users on our website who are under the age of
				thirteen years old. If you become aware of such a user, please
				notify us immediately. If you are reported as being in violation
				of our age policy, we may freeze your account and require that
				you submit satisfactory proof of age before you may continue
				using our service.
			</p>

			<h4>10. Amendments</h4>
			<p>
				We may amend this Privacy Policy under the same conditions as
				our Terms of Service. Your responsibility to keep yourself
				updated as to changes to this Privacy Policy is the same as in
				our “Amendments” section in our Terms of Service.
			</p>

			<h4>11. Users from outside the United States</h4>
			<p>
				We may have users who are from outside the United States. If you
				are, you are acknowledging that your information is being
				transferred from your country to ours. To the extent we are
				required, we maintain our Site and information collection
				practices in a way that conforms with most laws. If you are from
				a jurisdiction who's information collection practices differ
				from ours, please notify us so that we may take necessary
				action. This may include terminating your account and deleting
				your information. We are committed to resolving those issues, so
				if you have any questions about how we collect or use your
				information you may email us at musaremusic@gmail.com.
			</p>

			<h4>12. Deactivating your account</h4>
			<p>
				You may deactivate your account at any time by accessing your
				account settings, or send us a mail at musaremusic@gmail.com.
				When submitting your request, please let us know what led you to
				deactivate your account. Your feedback is greatly appreciated,
				and will help us to better accommodate members of the community.
