			<h1>MUSARE TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
			<h4>Last Updated: January 25, 2016</h4>

			<h4>1. Introduction</h4>
			<p>
				Musare.com (“musare” or the “Site”) is a social viewing platform
				that allows you and your friends to watch videos and listen to
				music together and to provide social commentary based on their
				experiences (collectively the “Content”). Before viewing, using,
				or interacting with our Site you must first agree to these Terms
				of (“Agreement” or “Terms”). When we say “you” we mean the
				person who is viewing, interacting, or registering with our
				Site, along with anyone that they may represent. When we say
				“Musare,” “musare.com,“ “us,” “our” or “we,” we are referring to
				the owners of the Site, and its successors and assigns. This
				Agreement, along with our Privacy Policy and any other
				agreements will govern our relationship. By using the Site, you
				acknowledge and accept the Site’s Privacy Policy and consent to
				the collection and use of your data in accordance with the
				Privacy Policy.
			</p>
			<p>
				In some instances, both these Terms and separate guidelines,
				rules, or terms of service or sale setting forth additional or
				different terms and/or conditions will apply to your use of the
				Site or to a service or product offered via the Site (in each
				such instance, and collectively “Additional Terms”). To the
				extent there is a conflict between these Terms and any
				Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control unless the
				Additional Terms expressly state otherwise.
			</p>

			<h4>2. Description of Service</h4>
			<p>
				Musare is an online platform that melds social media and
				entertainment. In other words, Musare is designed to allow you
				and your friends to watch videos or listen to music together. As
				part of our platform you will create a unique profile that will
				allow others to find you and for you to express yourself. As of
				now, we require all of our users to be at least 13 years old. If
				you are between the ages of 13 and 17 then we may require you to
				obtain permission from your parents to agree to these Terms. If
				you are under the age of majority in your state or jurisdiction
				of residence, you may use the Site only with involvement of a
				parent or guardian who agrees to these Terms and to be
				responsible for your use.
			</p>

			<h4>3. Accounts and Profiles</h4>
			<p>
				In order for you to access Musare we may require that you create
				a unique account to associate with a profile. You may be
				required to provide us with information, which includes, but is
				not limited to, your name, address, email address, a unique
				login name and password. The Site’s practices governing any
				resulting collection and use of your personal information are
				disclosed in its Privacy Policy. It is your responsibility to
				also keep this information updated and accurate.
			</p>
			<p>
				We may also allow you to use a third party API to sign up for
				our Site. Whenever you use this feature, certain information will
				be transferred from the third party account and will populate your
				profile here at Musare. It is important to read and understand that
				third parties privacy and information sharing practices and
				principles. More importantly, you will be making certain information
				publicly viewable.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you register for any feature that requires a password and/or
				username, then you will select your own password at the time of
				registration (or we may send you an e-mail notification with a
				randomly generated initial password) and you agree that: (i) You
				will not use a username (or e-mail address) that is already
				being used by someone else, may impersonate another person,
				belongs to another person, violates the intellectual property or
				other right of any person or entity, or is offensive. We may
				reject the use of any password, username, or e-mail address for
				any other reason in our sole discretion; (ii) You will provide
				true, accurate, current, and complete registration information
				about yourself in connection with the registration process and,
				as permitted, to maintain and update it including on your
				Profile Page, continuously and promptly to keep it accurate,
				current, and complete; (iii) You are solely responsible for all
				activities that occur under your account, password, and username
				– whether or not you authorized the activity; (iv) You are
				solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
				password and for restricting access to your Device so that
				others may not access any password protected portion of the Site
				using your name, username, or password; (v) You will immediately
				notify us of any unauthorized use of your account, password, or
				username, or any other breach of security; and (vi) You will not
				sell, transfer, or assign your account or any account rights.
			</p>
			<p>
				We will not be liable for any loss or damage (of any kind and
				under any legal theory) to you or any third party arising from
				your inability or failure for any reason to comply with any of
				the foregoing obligations.
			</p>
			<p>
				If any information that you provide, or if we have reasonable
				grounds to suspect that any information that you provide, is
				false, inaccurate, outdated, incomplete, or violates these
				Terms, any Additional Terms, or any applicable law, then we may
				suspend or terminate your account. We also reserve the more
				general and broad right to terminate your account or suspend or
				otherwise deny you access to it or its benefits – all in our
				sole discretion, for any reason, and without advance notice or
				liability.
			</p>
			<p>
				Your Site page where you maintain a profile (“Profile Page”) may
				not include any form of prohibited User-Generated Content
				(defined below), as outlined in Section 6 below. Without
				limiting the foregoing, Profile Pages may not include content
				that you are attempting to sell through the Site, and cannot be
				used to conduct commercial activities, including, but not
				limited to, transactions, advertising, fundraising, contests or
				other promotions absent our prior written consent. We may offer
				you the ability to set preferences relating to your profile or
				Site activities, but settings may not become effective
				immediately or be error free, and options may change from
				time-to-time. We assume no responsibility or liability for
				users’ Profile material.
			</p>
			<p>
				Profile Pages may only be set up by an authorized representative
				of the individual that is the subject of the Profile Page. We do
				not review Profile Pages to determine if they were created by an
				appropriate party, and we are not responsible for any
				unauthorized Profile Pages that may appear on the Site. If there
				is any dispute as to whether a Profile Page has been created or
				is being maintained by an authorized representative of the
				individual who is the subject of that Profile Page, then we
				shall have the sole right, but are not obligated, to resolve
				such dispute as we determine is appropriate in our sole
				discretion. Such resolution may include, without limitation,
				deleting or disabling access to Profile Pages, or any portion
				thereof, at any time without notice.
			</p>

			</p>
			<p>
				<b>B. Ownership.</b> The Site (including past, present, and
				future versions) and the Content are owned or controlled by
				Musare and our licensors and certain other third parties. All
				right, title, and interest in and to the Content available via

				non-transferable license to: (i) download (temporary storage
				only), display, view, use, play, and/or print one copy of the

				discretion, and without advance notice or liability. In some
				instances, we may permit you to have greater access to and use
				of Content, subject to certain Additional Terms.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>D. Rights of Others.</b> In using the Site, you must respect
				the intellectual property and other rights of Musare and others.
				Your unauthorized use of Content may violate copyright,
				trademark, privacy, publicity, communications, and other laws,
				and any such use may result in your personal liability,
				including potential criminal liability. Musare respects the
				intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that your
				work has been infringed by means of an improper posting or
				distribution of it via the Site, then please see Section 8
				below.
			</p>

			<h4>5. Content You Submit</h4>
			<p>
				<b>A. General.</b> Musare may now or in the future offer users
				of the Site the opportunity to create, build, post, upload,
				display, publish, distribute, transmit, broadcast, or otherwise
				make available on or submit through the Site (collectively,
				“submit”) messages, avatars, text, illustrations, files, images,
				graphics, photos, comments, responses, sounds, music, videos,
				information, content, ratings, reviews, data, questions,
				suggestions, personally identifiable information, or other
				information or materials and the ideas contained therein
				(collectively, “User-Generated Content”). Musare may allow you
				to do this through forums, blogs, message boards, social
				networking environments, content creation tools, gameplay,
				social communities, contact us tools, e-mail, and other
				communications functionality. Subject to the rights and license
				you grant in these Terms, you retain whatever legally cognizable
				right, title, and interest that you have in your User-Generated
				Content and you remain ultimately responsible for it.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>B. Non-Confidentiality of Your User-Generated Content.</b>
				Except as otherwise described in the Site’s posted Privacy
				Policy or any Additional Terms, you agree that: (a) your
				User-Generated Content will be treated as non-confidential –
				regardless of whether you mark them “confidential,”
				“proprietary,” or the like – and will not be returned, and (b)
				Musare does not assume any obligation of any kind to you or any
				third party with respect to your User-Generated Content. Upon
				Musare’s request, you will furnish us with any documentation
				necessary to substantiate the rights to such content and to
				verify your compliance with these Terms or any Additional Terms.
				You acknowledge that the Internet and mobile communications may
				be subject to breaches of security and that you are aware that
				submissions of User-Generated Content may not be secure, and you
				will consider this before submitting any User-Generated Content
				and do so at your own risk. In your communications with Musare,
				please keep in mind that we do not seek any unsolicited ideas or
				materials for products or services, or even suggested
				improvements to products or services, including, without
				limitation, ideas, concepts, inventions, or designs for music,
				web sites, apps, books, scripts, screenplays, motion pictures,
				television shows, theatrical productions, software or otherwise
				(collectively, “Unsolicited Ideas and Materials”). Any
				Unsolicited Ideas and Materials you post on or send to us via
				the Site are deemed User-Generated Content and licensed to us as
				set forth below. In addition, Musare retains all of the rights
				held by members of the general public with regard to your
				Unsolicited Ideas and Materials. Musare’s receipt of your
				Unsolicited Ideas and Materials is not an admission by Musare of
				their novelty, priority, or originality, and it does not impair
				Musare’s right to contest existing or future intellectual
				property rights relating to your Unsolicited Ideas and
				Materials.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>C. License to Musare of Your User-Generated Content.</b>
				Except as otherwise described in any applicable Additional Terms
				(such as a contest official rules), which specifically govern
				the submission of your User-Generated Content, you hereby grant
				to Musare, the non-exclusive, unrestricted, unconditional,
				unlimited, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, and cost-free
				right and license to use, copy, record, distribute, reproduce,
				disclose, sell, re-sell, sublicense (through multiple levels),
				display, publicly perform, transmit, publish, broadcast,
				translate, make derivative works of, and otherwise use and
				exploit in any manner whatsoever, all or any portion of your
				User-Generated Content (and derivative works thereof), for any
				purpose whatsoever in all formats, on or through any means or
				medium now known or hereafter developed, and with any technology
				or devices now known or hereafter developed, and to advertise,
				market, and promote the same. Without limitation, the granted
				rights include the right to: (a) configure, host, index, cache,
				archive, store, digitize, compress, optimize, modify, reformat,
				edit, adapt, publish in searchable format, and remove such
				User-Generated Content and combine same with other materials,
				and (b) use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques
				contained in any User-Generated Content for any purposes
				whatsoever, including developing, producing, and marketing
				products and/or services. You understand that in exercising such
				rights metadata, notices and content may be removed or altered,
				including copyright management information, and you consent
				thereto and represent and warrant you have all necessary
				authority to do so. In order to further effect the rights and
				license that you grant to Musare to your User-Generated Content,
				you also hereby grant to Musare, and agree to grant to Musare,
				the unconditional, perpetual, irrevocable right to use and
				exploit your name, persona, and likeness in connection with any
				User-Generated Content, without any obligation or remuneration
				to you. Except as prohibited by law, you hereby waive, and you
				agree to waive, any moral rights (including attribution and
				integrity) that you may have in any User-Generated Content, even
				if it is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you. To
				the extent not waivable, you irrevocably agree not to exercise
				such rights (if any) in a manner that interferes with any
				exercise of the granted rights. You understand that you will not
				receive any fees, sums, consideration, or remuneration for any
				of the rights granted in this Section 5(C).
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>D. Exclusive Right to Manage Our Site.</b> Musare may, but
				will not have any obligation to, review, monitor, display, post,
				store, maintain, accept, or otherwise make use of, any of your
				User-Generated Content, and Musare may, in its sole discretion,
				reject, delete, move, re-format, remove or refuse to post or
				otherwise make use of User-Generated Content without notice or
				any liability to you or any third party in connection with our
				operation of User-Generated Content venues in an appropriate
				manner. Without limitation, we may do so to address content that
				comes to our attention that we believe is offensive, obscene,
				lewd, lascivious, filthy, violent, harassing, threatening,
				abusive, illegal or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate, or
				to enforce the rights of third parties or these Terms or any
				applicable Additional Terms, including, without limitation, the
				content restrictions set forth below in Section 6. Such
				User-Generated Content submitted by you or others need not be
				maintained on the Site by us for any period of time and you will
				not have the right, once submitted, to access, archive,
				maintain, or otherwise use such User-Generated Content on the
				Site or elsewhere.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b
					>E. Representations and Warranties Related to Your
					User-Generated Content.</b
				>
				Each time you submit any User-Generated Content, you represent
				and warrant that you are at least the age of majority in the
				jurisdiction in which you reside and are the parent or legal
				guardian, or have all proper consents from the parent or legal
				guardian, of any minor who is depicted in or contributed to any
				User-Generated Content you submit, and that, as to that
				User-Generated Content, (a) you are the sole author and owner of
				the intellectual property and other rights to the User-Generated
				Content, or you have a lawful right to submit the User-Generated
				Content and grant Musare the rights to it that you are granting
				by these Terms and any Additional Terms, all without any Musare
				obligation to obtain consent of any third party and without
				creating any obligation or liability of Musare; (b) the
				User-Generated Content is accurate; (c) the User-Generated
				Content does not and, as to Musare’s permitted uses and
				exploitation set forth in these Terms, will not infringe any
				intellectual property or other right of any third party; and (d)
				the User-Generated Content will not violate these Terms
				(including the Rules) or any Additional Terms, or cause injury
				or harm to any person.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>F. Enforcement.</b> Musare has no obligation to monitor or
				enforce your intellectual property rights to your User-Generated
				Content, but you grant us the right to protect and enforce our
				rights to your User-Generated Content, including by bringing and
				controlling actions in your name and on your behalf (at Musare’s
				cost and expense, to which you hereby consent and irrevocably
				appoint Musare as your attorney-in-fact, with the power of
				substitution and delegation, which appointment is coupled with
				an interest).
			</p>

			<h4>6. Our Rules</h4>
			<p>
				We may, but are not obligated to, provide our users with the
				ability to post and receive messages from other Musare-listed
				users or allow you to participate in video or live chats with
				your friends or other users. If we do, you will not use the
				messaging system or your username to spam, defame, harass, or do
				anything we find to be objectionable (which is up to us),
				including, but not limited to, language that attacks or demeans
				a group based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability,
				gender, age, veteran status and sexual orientation or gender
				identity. It is your responsibility to maintain proper
				etiquette, and we reserve the right to terminate the account for
				anyone who violates our policies. We also do not monitor any
				particular chat, but reserve the right to edit, modify, ban, or
				filter any User-Generated Content or username for any reason. If
				someone posts something that is offensive or objectionable
				please let us know and we will do our best to accommodate you.
				We do not, however, assume any obligation to remove such
				User-Generated Content.
			</p>
			<p>
				You may share videos and music that is hosted on a third party
				website (i.e., Youtube, Soundcloud, etc.) but only if it does
				not conflict with their terms or any applicable law. You may
				not, however, share, post or otherwise communicate any content
				(video, audio, or text) that is unlawful, threatening, violent,
				pornographic, harassing, obscene, racist, defamatory, or
				otherwise objectionable. We reserve the right to determine what
				is objectionable at our sole discretion.
			</p>
			<p>In addition to the above, you agree that you will not:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					* Infringe on anyone's intellectual property or other legal
					rights (i.e. invasion of privacy).
				</li>
				<li>
					* Hack, crack, phish, SQL inject, or otherwise compromise
					the security of our website or its servers.
				</li>
				<li>
					* Solicit business, spam, or otherwise use our service for
					commercial purposes unless expressly authorized by us.
				</li>
				<li>
					* Defraud or threaten any of our users through any method,
					whether it be through our website or through another method
					of communication.
				</li>
				<li>
					* Create more than one active user account, or create a new
					user account if we have previously banned, suspended, or
					otherwise terminated your first user account.
				</li>
				<li>* Harass anyone.</li>
				<li>* Impersonate anyone.</li>
				<li>* Do anything unlawful or bad (we define what is bad)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				How we react to your violation of any of these Terms does not
				mean we will treat everyone the same. We may do anything from
				giving you a spoken warning, temporarily suspend your account,
				ban you, or take you to Court.
			</p>

			<h4>7. Sharing Videos and Music</h4>
			<p>
				Musare may permit you to share videos and music with your
				friends. We may also allow you to use video or live chat to
				discuss the video or music as it is playing. Please note,
				however, that we do not host any User-Generated Content
				ourselves. Instead, you must use our platform to share your
				video or music from the third party video hosting website. You
				agree that you will be responsible for the User-Generated
				Content you upload, and that nothing you share will infringe on
				the rights of anyone. Furthermore, you warrant you have the
				ability to grant the right to share such User-Generated Content
				without any obligation to pay any royalties to any copyright
				owner. You will be responsible for the payment of any royalty
				and any associated damages, fees, fines or penalties, in the
				event we find out you have shared User-Generated Content in
				violation of another’s intellectual property rights.
			</p>
			<p>
				Not to sound like a broken record, but we have to make sure you
				understand that you will be responsible for any User-Generated
				Content that you upload, including the consequences of any
				infringement. By sharing any User-Generated Content you are, in
				essence, utilizing a third party license to distribute and share
				User-Generated Content. You may only do this if the Site from
				which you are linking has given you a license to share such
				User-Generated Content in the manner contemplated. If it does
				not, then you cannot share that User-Generated Content.
			</p>
			<p>
				For further clarity, you must only distribute videos or music
				that you are legally permitted to...meaning you cannot share
				videos or music that violates anyone’s third party intellectual
				property rights. For example, you must not share anything that
				the third party site would prohibit. In addition you will not
				modify, edit, disassemble, or create derivatives of anything
				that you do not own the rights to.
			</p>
			<p>
				Should you believe that your rights are being infringed on by,
				please note that we are not responsible for hosting it and it is
				the third party site which is serving the file, and until is
				removed from the third party site, it will still be available
				through their search engine. As such, copyright notices should
				be sent to both us and the third party site, and you should
				visit their terms for more information.
			</p>

			<h4>8. DMCA Notices</h4>
			<p>
				We will respond appropriately to notices of alleged copyright
				infringement that comply with the U.S. Digital Millennium
				Copyright Act (“DMCA”), as set forth below. We have registered a
				Copyright Agent with the United States Copyright Office, which
				limits our liability under the DMCA. If you believe that your
				copyright has been infringed, please send us a message that
				contains:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>* Your name.</li>
				<li>
					* The name of the party whose copyright has been infringed,
					if different from your name.
				</li>
				<li>
					* The name and description of the work that is being
					infringed.
				</li>
				<li>* The location on our website of the infringing copy.</li>
				<li>
					* A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of
					the copyrighted work described above is not authorized by
					the copyright owner (or by a third party who is legally
					entitled to do so on behalf of the copyright owner) and is
					not otherwise permitted by law.
				</li>
				<li>
					* A statement that you swear, under penalty of perjury, that
					the information contained in this notification is accurate
					and that you are the copyright owner or have an exclusive
					right in law to bring infringement proceedings with respect
					to its use.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Musare’s designated Copyright Agent to receive notifications of
				claimed infringement is Musare, Inc., 5900 Wilshire Blvd, 21st
				Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90036 (Attn: Legal Department); email:
				musaremusic@gmail.com. For clarity, only DMCA notices should go
				to the Copyright Agent; am other feedback, comments, requests
				for technical support, and other communications should be
				directed to musare customer service.
			</p>
			<p>
				If sending the notification by e-mail, an electronic signature
				is acceptable.
			</p>
			<p>
				Upon notification of claimed infringement, we will respond
				expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material that
				is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing
				activity. We will also notify the person who posted, uploaded or
				otherwise placed the allegedly infringing material on the Site
				that we have removed or disabled access to such material.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you believe that material has been removed improperly, you
				must send a written counter notification to the Agent, and
				include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					* a. a physical or electronic signature of the subscriber;
				</li>
				<li>
					* b. identification of the material that has been removed or
					to which access has been disabled and the location at which
					the material appeared before it was removed or access to it
					was disabled;
				</li>
				<li>
					* c. a statement under penalty of perjury that the
					subscriber has a good faith belief that the material was
					removed or disabled as a result of mistake or
					misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;
				</li>
				<li>
					* d. the subscriber’s name, address, and telephone number,
					and a statement that the subscriber consents to the
					jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial
					district in which the address is located, or if the
					subscriber’s address is outside of the United States, for
					any judicial district in which the service provider may be
					found, and that the subscriber will accept service of
					process from the person who provided the original
					notification or an agent of such person.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Upon receipt of a counter notification complying with the
				foregoing requirements, we will promptly provide the person who
				I provided the original notification with a copy of the counter
				notification, and inform that person that we will replace the
				removed material or cease disabling access to it in ten (10)
				business days, unless we receive notice that the original
				notifier has notified the designated agent for the counter
				notifier that such person has filed an action seeking a court
				order to restrain the subscriber from engaging in infringing
				activity relating to the material on our system or network.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is our policy, in appropriate circumstances, to disable
				and/or terminate the accounts of users who are repeat
				infringers. It is also our policy to accommodate and not
				interfere with standard technical measures we determine are
				reasonable under the circumstances, i.e., technical measures
				that are used by copyright owners to identify or protect
				copyrighted works. We retain the discretion to handle
				non-compliant notices in whatever manner appears to be
				reasonable given the circumstances presented. There are
				penalties for submission of misleading information in connection
				with the process described herein.
			</p>

			<h4>9. Points and Virtual Currency</h4>
			<p>
				The Site may include virtual, in-game currency (“Virtual
				Currency”), such as credits, coins, ranks (“Name Tags”), XP,
				cash, or points (e.g., Experience Points), that may be purchased
				with “real world” money or obtained through spending time on the
				Site or otherwise interacting with a third-party service.
				Virtual Currency may be used to purchase virtual, in-game
				digital items (“Virtual Goods”). Your purchase or award of
				Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods are merely a grant by us to a
				limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-assignable, personal, and
				non-transferable right to use the Virtual Currency and Virtual
				Goods as part of the Site under these Terms and any applicable
				Additional Terms we provide at the time. Accordingly, you have
				no property, proprietary, intellectual property, ownership, or
				monetary interest in your Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods,
				which remain our Content and property. The right may be
				immediately suspended or terminated for any reason, in our sole
				discretion, and without advance notice or liability. We reserve
				the absolute right, at any time and in our sole discretion, to
				manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Currency
				and/or Virtual Goods.

			</p>
			<p>
				<b>A. First – Try To Resolve Disputes and Excluded Disputes.</b>
				If any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or
				relates to the Site, the Content, your User-Generated Content,
				these Terms, or any Additional Terms, whether heretofore or
				hereafter arising (collectively, “Dispute”), or to any of
				Musare’s actual or alleged intellectual property rights (an
				“Excluded Dispute”, which includes those actions set forth in
				Section 14.D), then you and we agree to send a written notice to
				the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute or
				Excluded Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our
				notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent
				contact information that you provide us. But if no such
				information exists or if such information is not current, then
				we have no obligation under this Section 14.A. Your notice to us
				must be sent to: Musare, Inc., 5900 Wilshire Blvd, 21st Floor,
				Los Angeles, CA 90036 (Attn: Legal Department). For a period of
				sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the
				other party, Musare and you will engage in a dialogue in order
				to attempt to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, though
				nothing will require either you or Musare to resolve the Dispute
				or Excluded Dispute on terms with respect to which you and
				Musare, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.

			<p><b>B. Forums For Alternative Dispute Resolution.</b></p>
			<p>
				<b>(i) Arbitration.</b> If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set
				forth in Section 14.A within sixty (60) days of receipt of the
				notice, then either you or we may submit the Dispute to formal
				arbitration in accordance with this Section 14.B. If we cannot
				resolve an Excluded Dispute as set forth in Section 14.A within
				sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then either you or we
				may submit the Excluded Dispute to formal arbitration only if
				you and Musare consent, in a writing signed by you and an
				officer or legal representative of Musare, to have that Excluded
				Dispute subject to arbitration. In such a case, (and only in
				such a case), that Excluded Dispute will be deemed a “Dispute”
				for the remainder of this Section 14.B.
			</p>
			<p>
				Upon expiration of the applicable sixty-day period and to the
				fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a Dispute will be
				resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the
				then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
				Arbitration Association (“AAA”). If the Dispute has a claimed
				value of not more than $250,000, then the arbitration will be
				heard and determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a
				retired judge or a lawyer with not less than fifteen (15) years’
				experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive
				practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the
				proceedings in accordance with the AAA’s Supplementary
				Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. If the Dispute has a
				claimed value of more than $250,000, or if Musare elects, in its
				sole discretion, to bear the costs of arbitration in excess of
				those that would occur for a proceeding before a single neutral
				arbitrator, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by
				a three-member panel, with one member to be selected by each
				party and the third (who will be chair of the panel) selected by
				the two party-appointed members or by the AAA in accordance with
				the Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator or arbitration
				panel, as the case may be, will apply applicable law and the
				provisions of these Terms and any Additional Terms, will
				determine any Dispute according to the applicable law and facts
				based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a
				reasoned award. If you and Musare do not both consent to the
				arbitration of an Excluded Dispute as set forth in the
				immediately preceding paragraph of this Section 14.B(i), then
				this paragraph and the remainder of this Section 14.B will not
				apply to the Excluded Dispute.
			</p>
			<p>
				If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal
				arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing
				date within sixty (60) days of the filing of a “demand for
				arbitration,” then either party can elect to have the
				arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and
				Mediation Services Inc. (“JAMS”) using JAMS’ streamlined
				Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration
				administration Site that you and an officer or legal
				representative of Musare consent to in writing. The substantive
				practice area requirements for the arbitrator and the $250,000
				threshold for a the number of arbitrators assigned to the
				Dispute set forth in the paragraph above for the AAA arbitration
				will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or another
				arbitration Site.

					>(ii) Nature, Limitations, and Location of Alternative
					Dispute Resolution.</b
				>
				In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the
				terms of these Terms (and any Additional Terms) and can award
				the prevailing party damages and other relief (including
				attorneys’ fees). However, WITH ARBITRATION (A) THERE IS NO
				JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION
				OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C)
				JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED. All
				parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own
				expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of
				their choosing. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required,
				then it will be conducted in the “metropolitan statistical area”
				(as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident
				at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration. You and we
				will pay the administrative and arbitrator’s fees and other
				costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but
				if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Musare to pay a
				greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this
				Section 14 to be enforceable, then Musare will have the right to
				elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration, or
				to decline to do so and have the matter resolved through the
				courts. Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable
				arbitration rules. The arbitrator’s decision must consist of a
				written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the
				Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings
				and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is
				based. Judgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any)
				may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the
				parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>C. Limited Time To File Claims.</b> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
				PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A
				DISPUTE (BUT NOT AN EXCLUDED DISPUTE) AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN
				YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET
				FORTH IN SECTION 14.A) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE
				ARISES – OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>D. Injunctive Relief.</b> The foregoing provisions of this
				Section 14 will not apply to any legal action taken by Musare to
				seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with,
				any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or
				damage) relating to the Site, any Content, your User-Generated
				Content and/or Musare’s intellectual property rights (including
				such Musare may claim that may be in dispute), Musare’s
				operations, and/or Musare’s products or services.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b
					>E. Small Claims Matters Are Excluded From Arbitration
					Requirement.</b
				>
				Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying
				claim of Disputes (but not Excluded Disputes) in small claims
				court, subject to Section 14.G.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>F. No Class Action Matters.</b> Disputes will be arbitrated
				only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with
				any other arbitration or other proceedings that involve any
				claim or controversy of any other party. But if, for any reason,
				any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected
				pursuant to Section 14.B(i) holds that this restriction is
				unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Section
				14.B to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought
				exclusively in court pursuant to Section 14.G.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>G. Federal and State Courts in Los Angeles.</b> Except to the
				extent that arbitration is required in Section 14.B, and except
				as to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any
				action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute
				may only be instituted in state or federal court in Los Angeles
				County, California. Accordingly, you and Musare consent to the
				exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for
				such matters.
			</p>

			<h4>15. Waiver of Injunctive or Other Equitable Relief</h4>
			<p>
				IF YOU CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE INCURRED ANY LOSS, DAMAGES, OR
				INJURIES IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SITE, THEN THE
				LOSSES, DAMAGES, AND INJURIES WILL NOT BE IRREPARABLE OR
				SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION OR TO OTHER EQUITABLE
				RELIEF OF ANY KIND. THIS MEANS THAT, IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR
				CLAIM, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT SEEK, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT
				BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN, ANY COURT OR OTHER ACTION THAT MAY
				INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY
				WEBSITE, APPLICATION, CONTENT, USER-GENERATED CONTENT, PRODUCT,
				SITE, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, LICENSED, USED OR
				CONTROLLED BY MUSARE (INCLUDING YOUR LICENSED USER-GENERATED
				CONTENT) OR A LICENSOR OF MUSARE.
			</p>

			<h4>16. Force Majeure</h4>
			<p>
				You agree that we are not responsible to you for anything that
				we may otherwise be responsible for, if it is the result of
				events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, acts
				of God, war, insurrection, riots, terrorism, crime, labor
				shortages (including lawful and unlawful strikes), any third
				party site being down, communication disruption, failure or
				shortage of infrastructure, zombie attacks, shortage of
				materials, or any other event beyond our control.
			</p>

			<h4>17. Cancellation of Service</h4>
			<p>
				You agree that we may cancel our service or the Site at any
				time, for any reason, without warning or compensation, even if
				we have been advised that it may result in a loss to you or any
				other party.
			</p>

			<h4>18. Severability</h4>
			<p>
				In the event that a provision of this Agreement is found to be
				unlawful or otherwise unenforceable, the Agreement will remain
				in force as though it had been entered into without that
				unlawful or unenforceable provision being included in it.
			</p>

			<h4>19. Update to Terms</h4>
			<p>
				These Terms (or if applicable Additional Terms), in the form
				posted at the time of your use of the Site to which it applies,
				shall govern such use (including transactions entered during
				such use). AS OUR SITE EVOLVES, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UNDER
				WHICH WE OFFER THE SITE MAY PROSPECTIVELY BE MODIFIED AND WE MAY
				CEASE OFFERING THE SITE UNDER THE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR
				WHICH THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY OFFERED. ACCORDINGLY, EACH TIME YOU
				SIGN IN TO OR OTHERWISE USE THE SITE YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A NEW
				AGREEMENT WITH US ON THE THEN APPLICABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
				AND YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY NOTIFY YOU OF OTHER TERMS BY POSTING
				THEM ON THE SITE (OR IN ANY OTHER REASONABLE MANNER OF NOTICE
				WHICH WE ELECT), AND THAT YOUR USE OF THE SITE AFTER SUCH NOTICE
				CONSTITUTES YOUR GOING FORWARD AGREEMENT TO THE OTHER TERMS FOR
				YOUR NEW USE AND TRANSACTIONS. Therefore, you should review the
				posted terms of Site and any applicable Additional Terms each
				time you use the Site (at least prior to each transaction or
				submission). The Additional Terms will be effective as to new
				use and transactions as of the time that we post them, or such
				later date as may be specified in them or in other notice to
				you. However, the Terms (and any applicable Additional Terms)
				that applied when you previously used the Site will continue to
				apply to such prior use (i.e., changes and additions are
				prospective only) unless mutually agreed. In the event any
				notice to you of new, revised or additional terms is determined
				by a tribunal to be insufficient, the prior agreement shall
				continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement
				occurs. You should frequently check the home page, your message
				account and the e-mail you associated with your account for
				notices, all of which you agree are reasonable manners of
				providing you notice. You can reject any new, revised or
				Additional Terms by discontinuing use of the Site and related
				services.
			</p>

			<h4>
				20. Investigations; Cooperation with Law Enforcement;
				Termination; Survival
			</h4>
			<p>
				Musare reserves the right, without any limitation, to: (i)
				investigate any suspected breaches of its Site security or its
				information technology or other systems or networks, (ii)
				investigate any suspected breaches of these Terms and any
				Additional Terms, (iii) investigate any information obtained by
				Musare in connection with reviewing law enforcement databases or
				complying with criminal laws, (iv) involve and cooperate with
				law enforcement authorities in investigating any of the
				foregoing matters, (v) prosecute violators of these Terms and
				any Additional Terms, and (vi) discontinue the Site, in whole or
				in part, or, except as may be expressly set forth in any
				Additional Terms, suspend or terminate your access to it, in
				whole or in part, including any user accounts or registrations,
				at any time, without notice, for any reason and without any
				obligation to you or any third party. Any suspension or
				termination will not affect your obligations to Musare under
				these Terms or any Additional Terms. Upon suspension or
				termination of your access to the Site, or upon notice from
				Musare, all rights granted to you under these Terms or any
				Additional Terms will cease immediately, and you agree that you
				will immediately discontinue use of the Site. The provisions of
				these Terms and any Additional Terms, which by their nature
				should survive your suspension or termination will survive,
				including the rights and licenses you grant to Musare in these
				Terms, as well as the indemnities, releases, disclaimers, and
				limitations on liability and the provisions regarding
				jurisdiction, choice of law, no class action, and mandatory
				arbitration.
