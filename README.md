# MusareNode
This is a rewrite of the original [Musare](https://github.com/Musare/MusareMeteor)
in NodeJS, Express, SocketIO and VueJS. Everything is ran in it's own docker container, but you can also run it without Docker.

The site is available at [https://musare.com](https://musare.com).

### Our Stack

   * NodeJS
   * MongoDB
   * Redis
   * Nginx (not required)
   * VueJS

### Frontend
The frontend is a [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) generated,
[vue-loader](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader) single page app, that's
served over Nginx or express. The Nginx server not only serves the frontend, but
also serves as a load balancer for requests going to the backend.

### Backend
The backend is a scalable NodeJS / Redis / MongoDB app. Each backend
server handles a group of SocketIO connections. User sessions are stored
in a central Redis server. All data is stored in a central MongoDB server.
The Redis and MongoDB servers are replicated to several secondary nodes,
which can become the primary node if the current primary node goes down.

We currently only have 1 backend, 1 MongoDB server and 1 Redis server running for production, though it is relatively easy to expand.

## Requirements
Option 1: (not recommended for Windows users)
 * [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

Option 2:
 * [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 	* nodemon: `npm install -g nodemon`
 	* [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation)
 * [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center)
 * [Redis (Windows)](https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis/releases/tag/win-3.2.100) [Redis (Unix)](https://redis.io/download)

## Getting Started
Once you've installed the required tools:

1. `git clone https://github.com/Musare/MusareNode.git`

2. `cd MusareNode`

3. `cp backend/config/template.json backend/config/default.json`

	Values:  
   	The `secret` key can be whatever. It's used by express's session module.  
   	The `domain` should be the url where the site will be accessible from, usually `http://localhost` for non-Docker.  
   	The `serverDomain` should be the url where the backend will be accessible from, usually `http://localhost:8080` for non-Docker.  
   	The `serverPort` should be the port where the backend will listen on, usually `8080` for non-Docker.  
   	`isDocker` if you are using Docker or not.  
   	The `apis.youtube.key` value can be obtained by setting up a [YouTube API Key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started).  
	To set up a GitHub OAuth Application, you need to fill in some value's. The homepage is the homepage of frontend. The authorization callback url is the backend url with `/auth/github/authorize/callback` added at the end. For example `http://localhost:8080/auth/github/authorize/callback`.
   	The `apis.recaptcha.secret` value can be obtained by setting up a [ReCaptcha Site](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin).  
   	The `apis.github` values can be obtained by setting up a [GitHub OAuth Application](https://github.com/settings/developers).  
   	`apis.discord` is currently not needed.  
   	The `apis.mailgun` values can be obtained by setting up a [Mailgun account](http://www.mailgun.com/).  
   	The `redis.url` url should be left alone for Docker, and changed to `redis://localhost:6379/0` for non-Docker.
   	The `mongo.url` url should be left alone for Docker, and changed to `mongodb://localhost:27017/musare` for non-Docker.  
   	The `cookie.domain` value should be the ip or address you use to access the site, without protocols (http/https), so for example `localhost`.   
   	The `cookie.secure` value should be `true` for SSL connections, and `false` for normal http connections.  

4. `cp frontend/build/config/template.json frontend/build/config/default.json`

	Values:  
   	The `serverDomain` should be the url where the backend will be accessible from, usually `http://localhost:8080` for non-Docker.   
   	The `recaptcha.key` value can be obtained by setting up a [ReCaptcha Site](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin).  
   	The `cookie.domain` value should be the ip or address you use to access the site, without protocols (http/https), so for example `localhost`.   
   	The `cookie.secure` value should be `true` for SSL connections, and `false` for normal http connections.  

Now you have different paths here.

####Docker

1. Build the backend and frontend Docker images (from the main folder)

   `docker-compose build`

2. Start the databases and tools in the background, as we usually don't need to monitor these for errors

   `docker-compose up -d mongo mongoclient redis`

3. Start the backend and frontend in the foreground, so we can watch for errors during development

   `docker-compose up backend frontend`

4. You should now be able to begin development! The backend is auto reloaded when
   you make changes and the frontend is auto compiled and live reloaded by webpack
   when you make changes. You should be able to access Musare in your local browser
   at `http://<docker-machine-ip>:8080/` where `<docker-machine-ip>` can be found below:

   * Docker for Windows / Mac: This is just `localhost`

   * Docker ToolBox: The output of `docker-machine ip default`

####Non-docker

Steps 1-4 are things you only have to do once. The steps after that are steps you want to do when you want to start the site.

1. In the main folder, create a folder called `.database`

2. Create a file called `startMongo.cmd` in the main folder with the contents:

		"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.2\bin\mongod.exe" --dbpath "D:\Programming\HTML\MusareNode\.database"

	Make sure to adjust your paths accordingly.

3. In the folder where you installed Redis, edit the `redis.windows.conf` file. In there, look for the property `notify-keyspace-events`. Make sure that property is uncommented and has the value `Ex`. It should look like `notify-keyspace-events Ex` when done.

4. Create a file called `startRedis.cmd` in the main folder with the contents:

		"D:\Redis\redis-server.exe" "D:\Redis\redis.windows.conf"

	And again, make sure that the paths lead to the proper config and executable.

5. Run `startRedis.cmd` and `startMongo.cmd` to start Redis and Mongo.

6. In a command prompt with the pwd of frontend, run `npm run development-watch`

7. In a command prompt with the pwd of backend, run `nodemon`

## Extra

Below is a list of helpful tips / solutions we've collected while developing MusareNode.

### Mounting a non-standard directory in Docker Toolbox on Windows

Docker Toolbox usually only gives VirtualBox access to `C:/Users` of your
local machine. So if your code is located elsewere on your machine,
you'll need to tell Docker Toolbox how to find it. You can use variations
of the following commands to give Docker Toolbox access to those files.

1. First lets ensure the machine isn't running

   `docker-machine stop default`

1. Next we'll want to tell the machine about the folder we want to share.

   `"C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxManage.exe" sharedfolder add default --name "d/Projects/MusareNode" --hostpath "D:\Projects\MusareNode" --automount`

2. Now start the machine back up and ssh into it

   `docker-machine start default && docker-machine ssh default`

3. Tell boot2docker to mount our volume at startup, by appending to its startup script
	```bash
	sudo tee -a /mnt/sda1/var/lib/boot2docker/profile >/dev/null <<EOF

	mkdir -p /d/Projects/MusareNode
	mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=50 d/Projects/MusareNode /d/Projects/MusareNode
	EOF
	```

4. Restart the docker machine so that it uses the new shared folder

   `docker-machine restart default`

5. You now should be good to go!

### Fixing the "couldn't connect to docker daemon" error

Some people have had issues while trying to execute the `docker-compose` command.
To fix this, you will have to run `docker-machine env default`.
This command will print various variables.
At the bottom, it will say something similar to `@FOR /f "tokens=*" %i IN ('docker-machine env default') DO @%i`.
Run this command in your shell. You will have to do this command for every shell you want to run `docker-compose` in (every session).

### Running Musare locally without using Docker

1. Install [Redis](http://redis.io/download) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community)

2. Install nodemon globally

   `npm install nodemon -g`

3. Install webpack globally

   `npm install webpack -g`

4. Install node-gyp globally (first check out https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation)

   `npm install node-gyp -g`.

5. In both `frontend` and `backend` folders, do `npm install`.

6. `nodemon backend/index.js`

### Calling Toasts

You can call Toasts using our custom package, [`vue-roaster`](https://github.com/atjonathan/vue-roaster), using the following code:

```js
import { Toast } from 'vue-roaster';
Toast.methods.addToast('', 0);
```
